# embedchain

This repository contains generative AI chat LLM models such as Bard, GPT, and Bing. These chat assistants not only provide you the answer in the form of text, but you can speak your question to them and get the answer in the form of a test and voice. 

Bard has a special feature of searching your query over the internet, so the information will be up to date.

embedChain.py file is the code for the EmbedChain model, in which you can put the webpage URL or any pdf files and can compare both and get answers by asking questions based on both sources.
